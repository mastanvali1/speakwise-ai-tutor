## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone & Install

git clone https://github.com/your-username/speakwise-ai.git
cd speakwise-ai

## If using a serverless backend for API proxy,

see /api/chat.js for setup.

### 2. Deploy or Open Locally

- You can use any static server for the frontend (e.g., `live-server`, Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- For production, deploy `/api/chat.js` as a serverless function (Vercel, Netlify Functions, etc.).

### 3. Set Your Gemini API Key (Backend)

Create a `.env` or platform environment variable:

GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key


### 4. Run

- Launch the frontend.
- Ensure `/api/chat` endpoint is accessible and proxying API calls securely.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment Notes

- **API Key Security:** Never expose your Gemini API key in frontend JS. Always use a backend (proxy) endpoint with proper environment variables.
- **Browser Support:** Works best in latest Chrome/Edge. Requires microphone and SpeechSynthesis API support.
- **Session:** Demo only; production should use secure authentication and proper session handling.

---

## üé® Customization

- **Glassmorphism:** Tweak the `.glass-panel` class or background colors for personality.
- **Voice Settings:** Adjust language/model in the SpeechSynthesis or Gemini prompt.
- **AI Prompting:** Edit the initial system prompt for your custom learning goals.
